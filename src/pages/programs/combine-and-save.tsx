Sure if you&apos;re coordinating a big wedding you might not be able to also do the bridal party&apos;s makeup on the big day (you&apos;ll be busy with planning duties), but most smaller-scale weddings or other special events should allow you some free time to offer makeup services. Your clients will love the flexibility you offer, not to mention the convenience of only having to hire a single professional who offers the full package!</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Interior decorating is all about having a good eye for color, proportions, and being good at planning. The Event Decor field requires the same skills, to be applied to a specific special event. Taking these two courses could allow you to expand your decorating business to also service event planners and private events, which could lead to a huge increase in sales and cross-selling to your clients.</p>

Why not skip the middle man and have the skills to offer the full service yourself? Again, clients will be thrilled to rely on a single professional who offers a no-hassle service like this.</p>

            <h3>Screenwriting + Master Makeup Artistry</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">Being a trained makeup artist can help you develop and sell your screenplays. Having the skills and expertise in makeup (or special FX makeup) can help you better envision the final product as you&apos;re developing your script. Furthermore, when selling your script, you can take the time to actually get a few models and develop a portfolio of concepts to give stakeholders a visual to go along with your written work.</p>

            <p className="mb-4">Event Decorators often need inspiration to create an event&apos;s theme. Being able to draw that inspiration from your clients&apos; life can make the event even more magical. The color consultant course shows you how to bring the color wheel to life and help your clients choose a color palette that speaks to them. As an event decorator, you can use these same skills to develop an event theme that will wow any client.</p>

Though most of QC&apos;s courses will come with complete business training, this training mainly focuses on how to start and manage your business (business plan, marketing, etc.). Some QC students could greatly benefit from a basic business communications course where the focus is on how to effectively connect with clients, colleagues, and stakeholders alike.</p>
